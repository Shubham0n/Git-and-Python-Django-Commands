Common strategies include "recursive" (the default), "ours," "theirs," "octopus," "subtree," and more.                                                                                   |
| `git merge --strategy-option=<option>`    | Pass an option to the merge strategy                          | Provides additional options or arguments to the specified merge strategy. The options available depend on the chosen strategy.                                                                                                               |
| `git merge --no-ff <branch>`              | Create a merge commit even for fast-forward merges            | Forces Git to create a merge commit, even when the merge could be performed as a fast-forward. This preserves the branch history and makes it clear that a merge occurred.                                                                    |
| `git merge --ff-only <branch>`            | Allow only fast-forward merges                                | Ensures that the merge can only be performed as a fast-forward. If the merge would result in a non-fast-forward merge, Git will abort the operation and prompt the user to perform the merge using `--no-ff` or resolve the situation manually. |
| `git merge --no-edit <branch>`            | Do not open an editor to edit the merge message               | Prevents Git from opening an editor to allow the user to edit the default merge commit message.

| `git gc --auto --quiet` | Run automatic garbage collection quietly                | This command runs automatic garbage collection quietly, without displaying any output or progress messages in the terminal. It cleans up unnecessary files and optimizes the repository in the background without interrupting the user.               |
| `git gc --aggressive --prune` | Perform aggressive garbage collection with pruning     | This command performs aggressive garbage collection while also removing unreachable objects from the repository. It optimizes the repository aggressively and removes any unreferenced objects to reduce its size significantly.                   |
